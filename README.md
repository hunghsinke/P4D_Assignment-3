# P4D_Assignment 3
 Programming for Design Assignment 3 One-page site
## Task 
For this assignment, we want you to conduct research around a set topic and create a one page web siteLinks to an external site. that provides the user with an interactive and engaging understanding of the topic.  The topic and resources about the topic are here.  You must use these resources at a minimum to inform your understanding of the topic.  You are encouraged to do additional research of your own to augment your understanding and get a better mark.

You should use a range of programming techniques covered in this unit as you build this site; don't get so carried away in your design that you forget this is actually an assignment on programming! :)  You are able to use additional libraries like jQuery in your production, but you are strongly discouraged from using libraries that take care of a lot of the programming work for you.  For example, there are some great scroller libraries out there that let you do fun effects without using any code; these should be avoided because they rob you of the chance of demonstrating your own skills.  If you were developing the site for normal circumstances you'd definitely look at using a library, but remember, this is an assignment about programming, so the more you can do yourself, the better!

## Submission
Upload your code to GitHub and share a working link on Canvas. 

You need to include (at a minimum):

index.html - the HTML markup for your one page site
index.css - the CSS stylesheet for your one page site
index.js - all javascript code used on your one page site
readme.md - a markdown file that contains your producer notes
lib/  (optional) - a folder containing any additional libraries or APIs you have used (eg: jQuery) - note the restriction above though!
assets/ (optional) - a folder containing any assets your site needs such as images
The optional elements really are optional.  You won't get or lose any marks by not having them or having them included; they're just there for people who might want to include images or other assets in their site.

## Assessment criteria
Minimum requirements to pass
In order to pass this assignment, you must:

Submit a complete working web site that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript components in the files and folders specified above - it is your responsibility to ensure that the site is complete and working prior to submission.  Sites that do not work will be required to resubmit and will be penalised with a mark reduction of 10%.
Demonstrate the ability to use Javascript as a design tool consistent with the material we have covered throughout the unit (basic programming constructs like variables, functions, conditionals and loops, use of the Web API to access and modify the DOM and respond to events such as mouse clicks)
submit developer notes in markdown format that highlights key issues and features of the submitted assignment
Present information about the topic consistent with the supplied materials

## Additional marks
Additional marks will count towards higher grades (credit, distinction, high distinction) and will be granted to assignments that demonstrate achievement beyond the requirements. Additional marks will be awarded for:

creativity and presentation - how creatively you respond to the topic and how innovative you are in the ways that you use the technology to support your design; also includes the overall presentation of the site and how favourably it compares with industry standards
technical achievement - demonstrating techniques that exceed the level discussed in classes - this normally involves doing additional study and learning from resources from unit notes and that you discover from your own research.  Avoid just copying online tutorials though, as this just shows you can cut and paste and leads you dangerously close to plagiarism.  Use online tutorials to learn how to do something, but write your own original code to demonstrate that you understand the concepts.
attention to detail - making sure your work has no typos or errors that affect the presentation of the web site; maintaining good separation between content, presentation and behaviour; commenting and documenting your code efficiently so that it's easy to understand the code you write and demonstrates that you understand what the code does.
engagement with topic - demonstrating additional research around the topic that gives your site additional depth and interest
self-reflection - how much insight your readme.md file and code comments provide into your production processes, understanding and approach to the assignment.  What we're looking for here is your ability to look at your own work critically; to recognise the things you did well and the things that you could have possibly improved.

## What library I use:
Mosonary- https://masonry.desandro.com/layout
This is used for the picture layout. 

I have tried to use Glide JS library, but it did not provide me with enough value to keep working on it. This was originally used to do a scrolling image collage. 

## Connect with Us page:
If you hover over the "Connect now" button, you will find the button will change to light green. When you click on the button, you will see it changed to a darker green. I chose three different green for this button. 


## Image use:
The image for the welcome message and about this website is from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander Studies (AIATSIS). 

Most of the images for the burial section is from https://www.ngunnawal.org/gallery.
